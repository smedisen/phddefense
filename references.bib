  abstract  = {Most preference-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms use reference points to articulate the decision maker's preferences. Since these algorithms typically converge to a sub-region of the Pareto-optimal front, the use of conventional performance measures (such as hypervolume and inverted generational distance) may lead to misleading results. Therefore, experimental studies in preference-based optimization often resort to using graphical methods to compare various algorithms. Though a few ad-hoc measures have been proposed in the literature, they either fail to generalize or involve parameters that are non-intuitive for a decision maker. In this paper, we propose a performance metric that is simple to implement, inexpensive to compute, and most importantly, does not involve any parameters. The so called expanding hypercube metric has been designed to extend the concepts of convergence and diversity to preference optimization. We demonstrate its effectiveness through constructed preference solution sets in two and three objectives. The proposed metric is then used to compare two popular reference-point based evolutionary algorithms on benchmark optimization problems up to 20 objectives.},

  abstract  = {Multi-objective optimization problems in the real world often involve a decision maker who has certain preferences for the objective functions. When such preferences can be expressed as a reference point, the goal of optimization changes from generating a complete set of Pareto-optimal solutions to generating a small set of non-dominated solutions close to the reference point. Reference-point based optimization algorithms are used for this purpose. The preferences of the decision maker in the objective space can be interpreted as knowledge in the decision space. Extracting this knowledge it-eratively from the solutions generated during optimization, and feeding it back into the optimization algorithm can in principle improve convergence towards the reference point. Since the knowledge is extracted during runtime, this approach is termed as online knowledge-driven optimization. In this paper a recent knowledge discovery technique called flexible pattern mining is used to extract explicit rules that are used to generate new solutions in R-NSGA-II. The performance of the proposed FPM-R-NSGA-II is demonstrated on 3, 5 and 10 objective DTLZ problems. In addition to converging to a set of preferred solutions, FPM-R-NSGA-II also converges to a set of explicit rules which describe the decision maker's preferences in the decision space.},

  abstract  = {The use of evolutionary algorithms for solving multi-objective optimization problems leaves the decision makers with a set of Pareto-optimal solutions to be considered in their decision making. Multi-objective optimization problems offer two spaces for a decision maker to analyze, the decision space and the objective space. In the literature, most of the focus has been on analyzing the objective space, however, in this paper, two procedures are presented for analyzing the decision space by identifying the variables that predominantly influence the structure of the objective space. Both procedures employ a recently proposed rule mining approach, which is used to find significant rules in terms of the variables. The rules are then combined and an influence score is calculated. The method is demonstrated on four problems, two scalable test problems (DTLZ2 and WFG2) with cases of three, five and seven objectives, one engineering design problem and one simulation-based optimization problem. The experiments show that the proposed approach is able to identify influential variables in most problem cases.},

  abstract       = {Usually, optimizing productivity and optimizing worker well-being are separate tasks performed by engineers with different roles and goals using different tools. This results in a silo effect which can lead to a slow development process and suboptimal solutions, with one of the objectives, either productivity or worker well-being, being given precedence. Moreover, studies often focus on finding the best solutions for a particular use case, and once solutions have been identified and one has been implemented, the engineers move on to analyzing the next use case. However, the knowledge obtained from previous use cases could be used to find rules of thumb for similar use cases without needing to perform new optimizations. In this study, we employed the use of data mining methods to obtain knowledge from a real-world optimization dataset of multi-objective optimizations of worker well-being and productivity with the aim to identify actionable insights for the current and future optimization cases. Using different analysis and data mining methods on the database revealed rules, as well as the relative importance of the design variables of a workstation. The generated rules have been used to identify measures to improve the welding gun workstation design.},

  pages     = {1--8},
  abstract  = {Although an entire frontier of Pareto-optimal solutions exists for multi-objective optimization problems, in practice, decision makers are often only interested in a small subset of these solutions, called the region of interest. Specialized optimizers, such as reference-point based evolutionary algorithms, exist that can focus the search to only find solutions inside this region of interest. These algorithms typically only modify the selection mechanism of regular multi-objective optimizers to preferentially select solutions that conform to the reference point. However, a more effective search may be performed by additionally modifying the variation mechanism of the optimizers, namely the crossover and the mutation operators, to preferentially generate solutions conforming to the reference point. In this paper, we propose a modular mutation operator that uses a recent knowledge discovery technique to first find decision rules unique to the preferred solutions in each generation. These rules are then used to build an empirical distribution in the decision space that can be sampled to generate new mutated solutions which are more likely to be closer to the preferred solutions. The operator is modular in the sense that it can be used with any existing reference-point based evolutionary algorithm by simply replacing the mutation operator. We incorporate the proposed knowledge-driven mutation operator into three such algorithms, and through benchmark test problems up to 10 objectives, demonstrate that their performance improves significantly in the majority of cases according to two different performance indicators.},

  abstract       = {Current market requirements force manufacturing companies to face production changes more often than ever before. Reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMS) are considered a key enabler in today&rsquo;s manufacturing industry to cope with such dynamic and volatile markets. The literature confirms that the use of simulation-based multi-objective optimization offers a promising approach that leads to improvements in RMS. However, due to the dynamic behavior of real-world RMS, applying conventional optimization approaches can be very time-consuming, specifically when there is no general knowledge about the quality of solutions. Meanwhile, Pareto-optimal solutions may share some common design principles that can be discovered with data mining and machine learning methods and exploited by the optimization. In this study, the authors investigate a novel knowledge-driven optimization (KDO) approach to speed up the convergence in RMS applications. This approach generates generalized knowledge from previous scenarios, which is then applied to improve the efficiency of the optimization of new scenarios. This study applied the proposed approach to a multi-part flow line RMS that considers scalable capacities while addressing the tasks assignment to workstations and the buffer allocation problems. The results demonstrate how a KDO approach leads to convergence rate improvements in a real-world RMS case.},

Applying simulation-based optimization techniques to their designs under different production volume scenarios has become valuable when RMS becomes more complex. Apart from proposing the optimal solutions subject to various production volume changes, decision-makers can extract propositional knowledge to better understand the RMS design and support their decision-making through a knowledge discovery method by combining simulation-based optimization and data mining techniques. In particular, this study applies a novel flexible pattern mining algorithm to conduct post-optimality analysis on multi-dimensional, multi-objective optimization datasets from an industrial-inspired application to discover the rules regarding how the tasks are assigned to the workstations constitute reasonable solutions for scalable RMS.},

  abstract     = {In many practical applications, the end-goal of multi-objective optimization is to select an implementable solution that is close to the Pareto-optimal front while satisfying the decision maker’s preferences. The decision making process is challenging since it involves the manual consideration of all solutions. The field of multi-criteria decision making offers many methods that help the decision maker in this process. However, most methods only focus on analyzing the solutions’ objective values. A more informed decision generally requires the additional knowledge of how different preferences affect the variable values. One difficulty in realizing this is that while the preferences are often expressed in the objective space, the knowledge required to implement a preferred solution exists in the decision space. In this paper, we propose a decision support system that allows interactive knowledge discovery and knowledge visualization to support practitioners by simultaneously considering preferences in the objective space and their impact in the decision space. The knowledge discovery step can use either of two recently proposed data mining techniques for extracting decision rules that conform to given preferences, while the extracted knowledge is visualized via a novel graph-based approach that allows the discovery of important variables, their values and their interactions with other variables. The result is an intuitive and interactive decision support system that aids the entire decision making process — from solution visualization to knowledge visualization. We demonstrate the usefulness of this system on benchmark optimization problems up to 10 objectives and real-world problems with up to six objectives.},

  abstract  = {Practical multi-criterion decision making not only involves the articulation of preferences in the objective space, but also a consideration of how the variables impact these preferences. Trend mining is a recently proposed visualization technique that offers the decision maker a quick overview of the variables' effect on the structure of the objective space and easily discover interesting variable trends. The original trend mining approach relies on a set of predefined reference directions along which an interestingness score is measured for each variable. In this paper, we relax this requirement by automating the approach to find optimal reference directions that maximize the interestingness for each variable. Additional extensions include the use of an Achievement Scalarizing Function (ASF) for ranking solutions along a given reference direction, and an updated interestingness score formulation for more appropriately handling discrete variables. We demonstrate the working of the extended approach on DTLZ2 and WFG2 benchmarks for up to five objectives and on a biobjective engineering design problem. The results show that the ability of the proposed approach to detect variable trends in high dimensional objective spaces is heavily dependent on the quality of the solutions used.},

The focus of the paper is on model-focused decision support systems using multicriteria models, and decision aids, of which differences between multiattribute utility theory, analytic hierarchy process, French and Belgian outranking methods, and other approaches are discussed. The underlying preference function assumptions of each approach are compared. The many very rich applications throughout the world are reviewed.},

  title     = {Decision Support Through Knowledge Management},
  abstract  = {This chapter explores the role of knowledge management for decision support. Traditional decision support focused on provision of analytical tools for calculating optimal solution for the decision problems. The modern approach to decision support assumes greater autonomy for the decision maker. The role of the system is in assisting a decision maker in finding relevant information, which the decision maker can convert to actionable knowledge by making sense of the problem situation. This requires the decision support system (DSS) to have an extended functionality for supporting knowledge work, including memory aids, explanation facilities, and some learning capability. DSSs supporting such functionality can be equally termed ``knowledge management systems.'' This chapter explores how decision support systems and knowledge management evolved in recent years. It identifies complementary features that these two fields furnish in supporting users to improve their abilities as intelligent knowledge workers. It argues that although these areas originated from different philosophical premises, computerized knowledge management has decision support as a core focus; at the same time, decision support systems will benefit if built with knowledge management functionality in mind. We suggest calling such systems ``knowledge work support systems'' emphasising the major focus of modern technology as a mediator between the user and the cognitive requirements of the task he or she needs to perform. We also explore some design principles for such systems following a design science approach.},

  abstract     = {Interactive multiobjective optimization methods cannot necessarily be easily used when (industrial) multiobjective optimization problems are involved. There are at least two important factors to be considered with any interactive method: computationally expensive functions and aspects of human behavior. In this paper, we propose a method based on the existing NAUTILUS method and call it the Enhanced NAUTILUS (E-NAUTILUS) method. This method borrows the motivation of NAUTILUS along with the human aspects related to avoiding trading-off and anchoring bias and extends its applicability for computationally expensive multiobjective optimization problems. In the E-NAUTILUS method, a set of Pareto optimal solutions is calculated in a pre-processing stage before the decision maker is involved. When the decision maker interacts with the solution process in the interactive decision making stage, no new optimization problem is solved, thus, avoiding the waiting time for the decision maker to obtain new solutions according to her/his preferences. In this stage, starting from the worst possible objective function values, the decision maker is shown a set of points in the objective space, from which (s)he chooses one as the preferable point. At successive iterations, (s)he always sees points which improve all the objective values achieved by the previously chosen point. In this way, the decision maker remains focused on the solution process, as there is no loss in any objective function value between successive iterations. The last post-processing stage ensures the Pareto optimality of the final solution. A real-life engineering problem is used to demonstrate how E-NAUTILUS works in practice.},
